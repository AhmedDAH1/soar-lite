"""
Deterministic checks around the model, applied in "guarded" mode.

A prompt can only ask the model to resist manipulation; these rules enforce
the parts that matter even when it doesn't:

1. Text in the untrusted alert data that looks like instructions to the
   triage system is flagged before the model sees it.
2. An alert that shows signs of manipulation (flagged here, or reported by
   the model) is never dismissed, and its severity is never lowered.
3. A dismissal needs confidence; an unsure "false_positive" is escalated.

Strict mode adds one more rule, written after the first evaluation showed
fooled models justifying dismissals with the attacker's own words ("as
indicated in the User-Agent string"):

4. A dismissal must cite trusted evidence: at least one record from the
   SOC's own data (asset inventory, allowlist, change ticket...) that exists
   for this alert. Models write citations as text ("asset: vuln-scan-01,
   role vulnerability scanner"); the record name is what's checked.
   An attacker can write anything into their attack, but nothing into those
   records.

The AI only ever suggests: the worst a fooled model can do in guarded mode
is send an alert to a human.
